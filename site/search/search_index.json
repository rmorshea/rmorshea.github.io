Technical Skills Advanced Intermediate Novice Languages Python Javascript Go, C++ Frameworks Flask , Asyncio React Tools Git, PyTest, Sphinx Docker, Jenkins, Travis CI Kubernetes Databases SQL (Postgres), Redis Clouds Google Cloud Platform, AWS Work Experience Senior Software Engineer | Cisco Smart Licensing Jul 2018 - Present - Brought onto Cisco's Engineering Licensing team as the first hire on a new project intended to serve Cisco's licensing needs for its present and future cloud products. Delivered software used by Cisco's new DNA Center and future products for years to come. Developed a Python flavor Cisco's Smart Licensing software from the ground up. Designed goals and deadlines for long term projects. Screened, interviewed, recommended, and trained new hires. Platforms Engineer | Primer AI Nov 2017 - Apr 2018 - Part of a growing team of engineers working to support data scientists working to develop machine learning solutions to text based problems. Resident Pythonista. Added backend REST API features and expanded test coverage. Built and deployed simple micro service using Python and Flask. Learned React on the job to aide in developing frontend components. Introduced teams to Jupyter as a tool for reproducible and shareable science. Engineer in Test | Apple Maps Jul 2017 - Nov 2017 - One of two engineers brought on to develop a UI test automation framework for a map editor used in the production pipeline for Apple Maps. Developed a framework around Selenium for easily testing UI applications. Expanded test coverage to relieve manual testers. Communicated with core devs to ensure products meet expectations.
