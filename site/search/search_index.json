Having worked on projects from their inception into the long decline he believes the written and verbal communication of one's work form the foundation of its sustainability. Technical Skills Advanced Intermediate Novice Languages Python Javascript Go, C++ Frameworks Flask , Asyncio React Tools Git, PyTest, Sphinx Docker, Jenkins, Travis CI Kubernetes Databases SQL (Postgres), Redis Clouds Google Cloud Platform, AWS Work Experience Sr. Software Engineer | Cisco Jul 2018 - Present - Brought onto Cisco's Engineering Licensing team as the first hire on a new project intended to serve Cisco's licensing needs for its present and future cloud products. Delivered to 3 product teams including Cisco's new DNA Center . Re-engineered Cisco's Smart Licensing for Python and the cloud. Designed goals and deadlines for long term projects. Screened, interviewed, recommended, and trained new hires. Platforms Engineer | Primer AI Nov 2017 - Apr 2018 - Part of a growing team of engineers working to support data scientists working to develop machine learning solutions to text based problems. Resident Pythonista. Added backend REST API features and expanded test coverage. Built and deployed simple micro service using Python and Flask. Learned React on the job to aide in developing frontend components. Introduced teams to Jupyter as a tool for reproducible and shareable science. Engineer in Test | Apple Maps Jul 2017 - Nov 2017 - One of two engineers brought on to develop a UI test automation framework for a map editor used in the production pipeline for Apple Maps. Developed a framework around Selenium for easily testing UI applications. Expanded test coverage to relieve manual testers. Communicated with core devs to ensure products meet expectations. Software Engineer | Matplotlib Jan 2017 - Jul 2017 - Refactored large portions of the codebase to use a new library called Traitlets for facilitating the development of interactive Matplotlib plots for Jupyter . Worked to refactor legacy code used by thousand of people. Created new API features for Traitlets that are now broadly within Jupyter. Became immersed in open source communities, workflows, and release cycles. Supplemental Work GSOC Mentor | Matplotlib Jun 2017 - Sep 2017 Guided a student through Google's Summer of Code as their sole mentor in order to continue the work of integrating Traitlets into Matplotlib . Reviewed the student's code Introduced them to Git and GitHub as tools for collaboration Organized and enforced regular meetings to display daily progress.
