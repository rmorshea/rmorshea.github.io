# Ryan Morshead

If only there was more time to explain how little time I seem to have... I write
[music](projects#music),
cook fancy meals, travel, hike, camp, backpack, love (or need?) coffee, swing dance on occasion,
and in whatever time is left... develop software for
[fun](projects#software)
and
[work](resume).
