## Supplemental Work

### 23andMentor • [23andMe](https://www.23andme.com/) • Jul 2020 - Sep 2020

Participated in 23andMe's mentoship pilot program. Taught a collegue with minimal coding
experience to code in Python through 1-2 hour weekly sessions. The curiculum was
relatively unstructured and primarilly guided by the mentee's curiosities and interests.
By the end of the program the mentee was able to:

- Write Python scripts to solve basic algorithms questions
- Reach out to other colleagues to find ways to apply her newfound skills

### GSOC Mentor • [Matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib) • Jun 2017 - Sep 2017

Guided a student through [Google's Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)
as their sole mentor in order to continue the work of integrating
[Traitlets](#traitlets-ipython-and-jupyter) into Matplotlib.

- Reviewed the student's code
- Introduced them to Git and GitHub as tools for collaboration
- Organized and enforced regular meetings to display daily progress.

## Owned Projects

### [:fontawesome-brands-github: IDOM](https://github.com/rmorshea/idom) - React, but in Python

Gives Python developers the power to create interactive web applications without
writing a single line of Javascript. IDOM takes large inspiration from
[React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) and effectively replicates
their behavior enabling users to define declarative and composable UI components.

## Maintained Projects

### [:fontawesome-brands-github: Traitlets](https://github.com/rmorshea/traitlets) - IPython and Jupyter

Traitlets is a pure Python library for enforcing strong typing, observing changes to
tracked data, and reading configuring values from files or from command line arguments.
Traitlets powers the configuration system of [IPython](https://ipython.org/) and
[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) and the declarative API of
[IPython's interactive widgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Widget%20Basics.html).
