## Software


### [<i class="fa fa-github"></i> iDOM](https://github.com/rmorshea/idom) - Python for the Web

Gives Python developers the power to create interactive web applications without
writing a single line of Javascript. iDOM was originally inspired by
[Jupyter Widgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Widget%20Basics.html)
and
[Nteract's VDOM](https://github.com/nteract/vdom),
however it breaks from both by allowing live updates to substantially sized frontend views.


### [<i class="fa fa-github"></i> Spectate](https://github.com/rmorshea/spectate) - MVC for Python

A library for Python 2 and 3 that can track changes to mutable data types. With spectate
complicated protocols for managing updates don't need to be the outward responsibility
of a user and can instead be done "automagically" in the background. For instance, syncing
the state between a server and client can controlled by spectate so user's don't have to.
