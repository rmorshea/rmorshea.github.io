## Software

### [<i class="fa fontawesome-brands-github"></i> IDOM](https://github.com/rmorshea/idom) - Python for the Web

Gives Python developers the power to create interactive web applications without
writing a single line of Javascript. IDOM was originally inspired by
[Jupyter Widgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Widget%20Basics.html){target=\_blank},
[Nteract's VDOM](https://github.com/nteract/vdom){target=\_blank},
and [React](https://reactjs.org/) however it breaks from both by allowing live updates
to frontend views.

### [<i class="fa fontawesome-brands-github"></i> Spectate](https://github.com/rmorshea/spectate) - MVC for Python

A library for Python 2 and 3 that can track changes to mutable data types. With spectate
complicated protocols for managing updates don't need to be the outward responsibility
of a user and can instead be done "automagically" in the background. For instance, syncing
the state between a server and client can controlled by spectate so user's don't have to.
