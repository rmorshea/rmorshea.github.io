The thing that stood out about Ryan was his interview project.

At Primer, we used to have applicants submit a small web application that would parse geo
data and support an API for nearest neighbor and full text searches.

Normally I give a week for the project, but Ryan was scheduled such that he only had two
days and he had relatively little experience with web development.

Not only did he deliver a working API with notes, but he also demonstrated it deployed
in a Docker container (which he had never used before) and gave a quick architectural
diagram and some notes about scaled deployments based on what he had read. All while
being completely humble and open to feedback about how it could be better.

When we hired him, he continued to demonstrate that same dogged determination to do good
work in an entirely unfamiliar domain (Primer produces on-prem AI software for analysis
of human text), finding and fixing issues related to distributed computing code that
had been written by ML engineers and data issues related to corrupted newsfeed data,
all while making solid contributions to the web application itself. Needless to say,
I could not find a single person who was not shocked and disappointed by his departure.

His knowledge of the inner workings of Python are easily some of the best I’ve seen,
topped only by a former Google engineer with a comp sci PhD, and he is also one of the
most genuine and cooperative people I have had the pleasure of working with.

If I had the headcount and the role for him, I’d easily rehire him again.
